/*-- some extra tips:
1.Use {padding:10%} to keep words a little from the wall.
2.Use Spooky Ipsum or Horror Ipsum to just waste space
3.When met with an image to add in as a background, use background-image: url(...) to add them
4.MAKE SURE TO WATCH FOR THE MINIMUM HEIGHT SO YOU DON'T ADD STUFF YOU SHOULDN'T!!
